## Weekly report 1

This week I have read about Huffman coding and the LZW-algorithm. I have also done a good amount of configuration to get a gradle project running.
The program itself hasn't been started yet but my project is now set up such that I can start coding without any hassle.

The only thing that caused trouble so far was setting up gradle but after a good amount of googling I think my gradle.build is now structured correctly.

Next week I will start actually coding the project, I think the best approach would be to first implement one of the algorithms to the point where I can compress
and decompress .txt files. We'll see how long this takes, but after that I can start implementing my own data structures to use instead of the standard ones.

## Time spent

Overall the studying and configuring took about 5 hours.
